    <p class="head">Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP)</p>
    <p class="gro">The Bharatiya Janata Party  is a political party in India and one of the two major Indian political parties alongside the Indian National Congress.[37] Since 2014, it has been the ruling political party in India under the incumbent Prime Minister Narendra Modi.[38] The BJP is aligned with right-wing politics and has close ideological and organisational links to the Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh (RSS) volunteer paramilitary organisation.[39] Its policies adhere to Hindutva, a Hindu nationalist ideology.[40][41] As of December 2023, it is the country's biggest political party in terms of representation in the Parliament of India as well as state legislatures.</p><br>
    <p class="gro">The party's origins lie in the Bharatiya Jana Sangh, which was founded in 1951 by Indian politician Shyama Prasad Mukherjee.[42] After the Emergency of 1975–1977, the Jana Sangh merged with several other political parties to form the Janata Party; it defeated the then-incumbent Indian National Congress in the 1977 general election. After three years in power, the Janata Party dissolved in 1980, with the members of the erstwhile Jana Sangh reconvening to form the modern-day BJP. Although initially unsuccessful—winning only two seats in the 1984 general election, it grew in strength on the back of the movement around Ram Janmabhoomi in Uttar Pradesh. Following victories in several state elections and better performances in national elections, the BJP became the largest political party in the Parliament in 1996; however, it lacked a majority in the lower house of Parliament, and its government, under its then-leader Atal Bihari Vajpayee, lasted for only 13 days.</p>
