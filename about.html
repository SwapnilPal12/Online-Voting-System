       <p class="gro">An online voting system is a software platform that allows groups to securely conduct votes and elections.</p> 
       <p class="gro"> High-quality online voting systems balance ballot security, accessibility, and the overall requirements of an organization's voting event.</p>
       <p class="gro">At their core, online voting systems protect the integrity of your vote by preventing voters from being able to vote multiple times. </p>
       <p class="gro">As a digital platform, they eliminate the need to gather in-person, cast votes using paper, or by any other means </p>
       <p class="gro">(e.g. email, insecure survey software).</p>
