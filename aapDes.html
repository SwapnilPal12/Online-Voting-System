    <p class="head">Aam Aadmi Party (AAP)</p>
    <p class="gro">The Aam Aadmi Party (transl.â€‰Common Man's Party; abbr. AAP) is a political party in India. It was founded on 26 November 2012 by Arvind Kejriwal and his then-companions,[26] following the 2011 Indian anti-corruption movement. AAP is currently the governing party in the Indian state of Punjab and the union territory of Delhi. On 10 April 2023, AAP was officially granted the status of National party by ECI.[27] The party's election symbol is a broom.[28] The party is currently part of the coalition I.N.D.I.A Alliance.</p><br>
    <p class="gro"> The party came into existence following a difference of opinion between Kejriwal and activist Anna Hazare regarding the incorporation of electoral politics into the popular 2011 Indian anti-corruption movement, which had been demanding a Jan Lokpal Bill since 2011.[30] Hazare preferred the movement should remain politically unaligned, whereas Kejriwal felt the failure of the agitation route necessitated changes in the government's representation itself.[30] On 3 December 2015, the Jan Lokpal Bill was passed by the AAP government with a majority in the Delhi legislative assembly</p>
